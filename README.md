A minimal, unopinionated, and accessible CSS reset/normalization that correctly accounts for [HTML5 elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

### üëå Minimal

> üìù **NOTE:** A wholehearted attempt has been made to include only the minimal rules necessary, and all rules and declarations are thoroughly explained in comments; the rules included are the bare minimum required to correctly reset styles for all appropriate [HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) in a manner that does not tamper with the natural accessibility of semantic HTML in an unaltered state.

- Nothing included without an explanation or a reason.
- Legacy conventions in other "resets" and "normalizations" audited and edited/removed.
- Deprecated elements removed.
- Main file is minified.

### ü§´ Unopinionated

- The included rules are only intended to "reset" the styles for all appropriate [HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), **NOT** to also add a layer of opinionated, 
default" styles on top of the reset.
- These styles are meant to have a true blank-slate effect.
- Meant to be used by developers in projects where themes/default styles are being added on top of the reset.
- Avoids necessitating an additional complementary stylesheet in order to remove opinionated styles added after using a package like [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/).

### ‚ôøÔ∏è Accessible

- Accessibility-In-Mind: accessibility was a main focus when creating this package.
- Does not remove, or mess with in any way, the default focus state styles!
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è You should _never_ remove/hide/suppress the default `:focus` outline styles without creating a custom one to override it.
- Sets `font-size` to `100%` and includes a note on why this is important.
- Sets default `line-height` on `body` and includes a note (and [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/line-height#accessibility_concerns)) on why this is important.
- Ensures that `[hidden]` attribute styles are honored.
- Ensures that elements that are hidden are done so using `display: none`, as this also removes them from the accessibility tree.
- Doesn't mess with the user's ability to zoom.
- In the interest of also being minimal and unopinionated, there are no expendable or superfluos styles added that could potentially have irrevocable unintended affects on a site's accessibility.

### üì± Modern

- Includes styles for all appropriate [HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), including elements left out in Eric Meyer's OG [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/).
- Correctly resets new HTML5 elements for custom styling, like `<button>` and `<select>`.
- Correctly styles multimedia elements to reduce the likelihood of unintended side-scroll.
- Ensures a `pointer` cursor shows on all appropriate interactive elements.
- Includes modern browser support ([see below](#browser-support)).

## üèó Browser Support

The styles in this project are compiled using rules that support the last 2 versions, and any version with coverage greater than 1%, of all modern browsers supported by [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).

```text
> 1%
last 2 versions
```

## üòû Why

This package, and included main stylesheet, was born out of years of frustration and disappointment with the evolution of the standard available tools to "reset" or "normalize" your CSS before creating your own styles/theme.

After years of creating a custom `_reset.scss` partial to fully rest my own styles on top of [Reset CSS](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) or [Normalize](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/), I decided to research what other options are out there... surely there has to be a modern, accessible, unopinionated alternative? And here enters my disappointment - while there are some hopeful possibilities based on package names, I couldn't find anything that ticked all the boxes above.

So instead, I decided - why not pick and choose the best from all of them, audit what should actually be there, and create one package to in the darkness bind them.

> üìù **NOTE:** The goal of this package is to correctly reset/normalize browser-default styles, creating a "blank slate" or "blank canvas" effect for you to then write your own styles on top of. Once you have included these styles, you can then begin writing your own base styles on top of them; it does NOT create a base or default set of styles for you to immediately begin authoring content with - this is left up to you. Happy styling!

import 'reset-css';
```

## üí£ Testing

There is an included `tags.html` file intended to act as an example page. You can load this file locally in any browser to see how all elements look in the different browsers after the `css-init` styles are loaded; you will be able to note the differences in browser default styles, while also noting the consistency in the styles that are reset across.

> **üö®NOTE:** this file is NOT meant to be accessible (hypocritical, I know...); but it's NOT meant to be a styleguide, rather just a page to view the elements (_styleguide and end-to-end testing with [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) coming soon!_ üôå)

> üìù **NOTE:** you can use this same file as a generic styleguide or test file once you have added your own theme styles as well, but we recommend creating your own to test additional styles (that are most likely added with classes).
